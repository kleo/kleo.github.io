<p>I still have this note dated 2013-07-04 named grub.txt.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>set root=(hd0,msdos6)
</span><span>set prefix=(hd0,msdos6)/boot/grub
</span><span>insmod normal
</span><span>normal
</span></code></pre>
<p>I found out about Linux first at a Apple Store lol.</p>
<p>This was at Plazuela de Iloilo, probably went there to wander at new shops with my parents.</p>
<p>One of those laptops they sold that wasn't a Mac came in preinstalled with Ubuntu.</p>
<p>I wondered what is this? A computer not running Windows or MacOS? What is this sorcery?</p>
<p>It had a peculiar animal as a wallpaper, turns out the Ubuntu version was Precise Pangolin.</p>
<p>When we went home I had to try it out.</p>
<p>It was no easy matter to start, with it not properly working after install.</p>
<p>On startup it boots to a grub prompt which was very disappointing.</p>
<p>After looking far and wide trying out different solutions I finally found the fix and made the note above.</p>
<p>This experience started my fascination with terminals.</p>
<p>I was hoping this was the last problem I have on using Linux.</p>
<p>Or is it?</p>
