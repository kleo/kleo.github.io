While there are so many WiFi access points all around us, we can't connect to them because they're secured with a password, but we won't bother asking for the WiFi password.\nLet's connect to wireless access points that still have default passwords configured.\nAfter a router has been setup by the Internet service provider here in the Philippines, ideally they tell you to change the WiFi password, but still many routers go used everyday and still have their default WiFi password configuration.\nTo change the WiFi password mind you, using the router's web interface, typing in the router's IP address on a web browser. Then after going to addresses, you login using their default login credentials, go to wireless configuration optionally set security options and changing the WiFi password.\nToo easy for the end user?\nTo identify the router's default WiFi password we need an application, preferably using an Android phone to scan for wireless access points currently around.\nNo need for apps with fancy names like \"WiFi Password Hacker\", those will just simply disappoint you and even contain malware.\nUsing an Android phone with PingTools, available on Google Play for free or using an Android phone with WiFi Analyzer, an open source application available on Google Play for free. Source.\nAfter scanning, we can view the router's Service Set Identifier (SSID) or the name of the WiFi network, and it's Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID) or MAC address of the router.\nWe can now use that to connect to our prefered WiFi access point.\nPLDT ZXHN H108N\nUsing PingTools WiFi scanner, we can see the MAC address of the router and we can now identify the router's default WiFi password configuration.\n\nNow lets combine them\nSSID: PLDTHOMEDSL_4A16E\nMAC: 94:A7:B7:34:A1:6E\nPLDTWIFI + Last 5 characters of MAC address uppercase\nPassword: PLDTWIFI4A16E\n\nIterations on PLDT routers\nSSID: PLDTHOMEFIBR + 4A16E(Last 5 characters of MAC address uppercase)\nPassword: PLDTWIFI + B5E91(Last 5 characters inverted MAC hex value uppercase)\nSSID: PLDTmyDSLPAL\nPassword: PLDTWIFI + Last 5 characters of MAC address uppercase\nSSID: PLDTmyDSLBiz\nPassword: PLDTWIFI + Last 5 characters of MAC address uppercase\nSSID: PLDTHOMEFIBR + Last 5 characters of MAC address\nPassword: wlan + Last 5 characters of inverted MAC hex value\nPassword-Example: wlanB5E91\nSSID: HomeBro_Ultera\nPassword: HomeBro_ + Last 6 characters inverted MAC hex value\nPassword-Example: HomeBro_CB5E91\nInverted MAC hex value\n0 - F\n1 - E\n2 - D\n3 - C\n4 - B\n5 - A\n6 - 9\n7 - 8\n8 - 7\n9 - 6\nA - 5\nB - 4\nC - 3\nD - 2\nE - 1\nF - 0\nEPON ONU\nAn example with routers that are rearranging parts of the MAC address as default WiFi password.\n\n\nGlobe PROLiNK H5400NK ADSL Wireless Modem\nOn Globe routers, placing the word \"WIFI\" in between the last 6 characters of its MAC.\n\n\n\nA reminder to change your router's passwords folks, enjoy~\nReferences: Symbianize (Mobilarian)\n","id":"https://kleo.hak.dog/default-wifi-passwords/","title":"Default WiFi passwords"},"https://kleo.hak.dog/dmca-takedown-notice-from-github/":{"body":"I received a DMCA notice for my Github repository kbeflo/evilportals, it has phishing pages that uses trademarks from multiple companies without permission.\nAlthough I included a disclaimer in README.md:\nUsage of Evil Portals for attacking infrastructures without prior mutual consistency can be considered as an illegal activity.

The technicians finished setting up the fiber connection, router and phone. They head on home.\nAccessed the web interface on my computer at 192.168.1.1 with the default username admin and password 1234. Initial setup was a breeze, asking for a new admin password, WiFi password for 2.4GHz and 5GHz.\nWhile all is well first thing I noticed is the very limited settings on its web interface, bummer.\nScanning for urls\nSo to try a few things, I booted up Kali Linux and went on to use dirb, a web content scanner. Basically it looks for existing (and/or hidden) Web Objects.\n\nNow looking at the urls, they end with .asp, let's try adding an option to dirb to end with .asp file extension.\n\nWhile I found just a couple of additional hidden urls, these won't be enough.\nAll hope is not lost\nLuckily I found a similar router page for the AN5506-04-FA router. You can find the page at Hackcorrelation. Mirrors 1 2\nThe article provided me file urls such as http://192.168.1.1/menu/sfu/ph_pldt/hisi5116/voip_dualwifi/sip/1.xml which contained more hidden urls on the router.\nNow I can do so much more, like port forwarding and increasing WiFi power to 200%!\nI listed all the hidden urls and files at https://github.com/bkspc/fiberhomesuperadmin/\nConsole access\n","id":"https://kleo.hak.dog/pldt-home-fiber-router-hacking/","title":"PLDT Home Fiber router hacking"},"https://kleo.hak.dog/pldt-home-fiber-web-interface-admin-access/":{"body":"Enable web interface admin access for advanced configuration, port forwarding, and more.\n\nHidden urls\nConsole access\nRouter firmware and files\nAdmin access\n\nAcknowledgements\nTo our small community that has grown due to the restrictions the ISP has presented to us.

I just used the ones from my logic analyzer just laying around.\nRisks:\nChances of bricking router if done wrong: 0%, assuming you do not do rm -rf /.\nCaution:\nIf at any time you mess up during this process, the easiest way to start over is by restarting your router by unplugging it.\nDo not do step 13 if you are not confident that you did everything right. Step 13 is the point of no return!\nCharacters that are highlighted with red are commands and characters that are in bold are keystrokes.\nInstructions:\n1.) Turn off your AN5506-04-FA router.\n2.) Open it up, stick in the serial port cables into the port and the converter itself.\n3.) Plug in your converter into your computer and make sure it's working properly.\n3.1.) You might need to install a driver if you use the converter linked by @kbeflo. Driver link: here.\n4.) Open up PuTTY, select 'Serial', put in the serial line of your converter, in my case it was 'COM3', put '115200' as the speed, and click Open.\nDon't know what your serial line is? Try COM3 or check Communication Ports in Device Manager. Look for \"Silicon Labs CP201x USB to UART Bridge\". The characters enclosed in parentheses beside it are the ones you're looking for. (For example, \"(COM3)\". Use \"COM3\" as your serial line.)\n5.) Double-check to make sure you are avoiding the VCC port like the plague. Otherwise, you might fry your converter as well!\n6.) Cross your fingers and hope nothing catches fire. Power up that router!\n7.) Immediately you'll be assaulted by boot-up messages. Wait for the 'Press Ctrl+C to stop auto-setup' prompt. You have 2 seconds to do this. Be quick!\nIf you react too slow and missed the prompt, turn your router on and off again to start over.\n8.) You should now be in the linux kernel of your router. Evident by it saying ~ #. It's now waiting commands from its owner, you! (And not PLDT!)\n9.) Type this in exactly: cd fhcfg. Press enter.\n9.1.) By default the configuration file web_accout_enable is a read only file. Set permissions for that file so we can have write access. Using chmod 755 web_accout_enable.\n10.) Type this in exactly: vi web_accout_enable (vi is a text editor and web_accout_enable is the configuration file). Yes, do not try to autocorrect that typo. The file itself is typoed!\n11.) We're only interested in the number 0 there. Ignore the rest of the garbage characters. Press i on your keyboard to enable editing mode.\n12.) Press 1 on your keyboard. You can see that the \"0\" became \"10\" Delete the \"0\" by pressing the delete key on your keyboard.\n13.) Press Esc to exit editing mode and re-enter command mode. Type this in exactly: :wq. Press enter.\n14.) Once you see /fhcfg # again, you can now turn off your router, unplug everything, and place the cover again.\n15.) Make sure that the optical cable is unplugged from the router to not get locked out again immediately after turning the router on! Turn the router on after doing this.\n16.) Wait for it to finish booting up. Go to your router administrator page http://192.168.1.1/fh and log in with these credentials:\nAdministrator: adminpldt\nPassword: 6GFJdY4aAuUKJjdtSn7dC2x\n17.) Set everything up the way you like it, free from the control of the hands of PLDT. Go wild!\n18.) Make sure to disable everything remote control related. TR-069, ACL, Remote access, etc.\n19.) Plug in your optical cable again. Expect to get locked out after a few minutes again.\nJust do this tutorial again if you ever need to regain adminpldt.\n20.)

Well here in the Philippines, routers come with privileged backdoor login, where we can access the router's configuration, where we can set the WiFi network name(SSID) or even change the WiFi password, or just view the current configuration, such as the WiFi password in plain text.\nThe vulnerability exists between common routers used in the Philippines, these are the Globe PROLiNK H5004NK and the PLDT BaudTec RN243R4-2T2R-A6.\nPhysical access attack\nPhysical access is a term in computer security that refers to the ability of people to physically gain access to a computer system. The best network software security measures can be rendered useless if you fail to physically protect your systems.\nScenario\nWe will need to have physical access to a computer already connected to the network. This can commonly be found on homes, internet cafes, and workplace networks where the router isn't secured behind a firewall.\nThey come with an open ssh service on port 22, with default usernames and passwords. An added bonus is that these accounts' passwords cannot be changed and cannot be removed, so we can use them to login to any of these routers at any time we want.\nGlobe PROLiNK H5004NK\n\nXXXX being the last 4 characters of the device's MAC address.\nPLDT BaudTec RN243R4-2T2R-A6\n\nXXXX being the last 4 characters of the device's MAC address.\nAccessing the the router's command line interface\nYou can find the router's IP address on Windows using cmd, then entering ipconfig command, normally this would be the default gateway on most unsecured networks.\n\nTo identify the router's MAC address you can simply go to the router's IP address and access it's web interface and view all it's info without even logging in.\n\nWe will need an ssh client to connect to the router, we'll be using PuTTY an ssh client for Windows as an example.\nEnter the gateway IP address (e.g 192.168.254.254) and ssh default port 22 and open connection.\n\nNow we can login to ssh using the privileged backdoor username and password and view the WiFi password by entering shell using sh command, then show wlan config command.\n\nWe'll get a list of the router's wireless configuration, now look for these entries,\n\nWLAN SSID is our WiFi access point name, and WLAN WPA_PSK is the WiFi password.\nThere you have it, the WiFi password in plain text.

As there isn't any option to remove it.\n\nI tried using the OBS Studio filter crop at first but I needed a much effective solution.\nI found Sony-PMCA-RE which is a tool that interfaces with Sony digital cameras through USB. It allows to tweak settings, dump firmware, and in some cases install custom Android apps.\nFollowed through Clean HDMI for DSC-HX200V and Support for DSC-HX100V.\nFirst I tried to run the commands on using python pmca-console.py updatershell but it updates the firmware which in turn loses the changes that I made. I could still backup the relevant files.\n\n\nNext I had to try python pmca-console.py serviceshell. The address 0x01070330 is for removing the EV value from the screen. This will also lock exposure value to zero.\n\nChanges I make now persists even after battery removal.
