<p>A little history on this phone</p>
<p>My parents bought me a Xperia C5 Ultra (E5553) phone while I was still studying at college, bought at around 2015.</p>
<p>Since graduating battery died and I haven't replaced it ever since.</p>
<p>Buying a manufactured battery for a very old phone would be at a terrible quality by then.</p>
<p>I rooted this phone before when it was still on Android 5 with bootloader unlocked. Sadly I messed it up badly so I had no choice but to use Xperia Companion to recover it.</p>
<p>Unrooted, bootloader locked, recovery mode lost. Well at least I still have a working phone.</p>
<hr />
<p>Previously I modded this phone with 1 USB cable for power and another connected to its USB micro port for helping it boot and maintain being powered on.</p>

<p>For reference I found on google the pinouts for my phone here <a href="http://www.u2ugsm.com/blog/sony-xperia-c5-ultra-battery-connector-terminal/">u2ugsm.com</a></p>
<p>Replace blue with green + (RX) and replace yellow with white - (TX)</p>

<p>I attempted to do serial and power with 1 cable but it isn't enough, phone won't power on. I forgot to take a picture on that attempt :\</p>
<p>Next I used 2 cables, one for serial and one for power</p>

<p>A closer look at my awful soldering skills</p>

<p>Really happy with the outcome. I could do USB adb and use <a href="https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy">scrcpy</a>!</p>

<p>I'm salty on the support Sony did on this phone, Android support only up to Marshmallow and no wireless adb but still this phone still feels like brand new.</p>
